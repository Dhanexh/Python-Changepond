OOP's:
    - Our program around function ie Block of statements that manipulate data. This  is called the 
        procedure-oriented way programming 
    - There is another way of organinzing your program which is to combined data and functionality 
        ans warp it inside something called an object.This is called as Object-Oriented programming
    
OOP's Concept:
    - class
    - objects
    - polymorphism
    - encapsulation
    - inheritance
    - data abstraction


Class:
    - Class is a collection of objects
    - A Class is a blueprint for how something should be defined
    - Class define the functions called methods,which identify the behaviours that an object created from the 
        classes can perform with its data

Objects:
    - Objects are anything that has properties and some behaviours
    - Properties of objects -> variables
    - behaviours -> functions of objects
    - the properties that all objects have are defined in a method called __init__()
    - __init__ sets the initial state of object



Property() - method is a inbuilt function
            Allows us to create a special type of attribute called a Property for a class
            Way to manage attribute access encapsulation and validation within the class
            The property() function can be used instead of the @property decorator to achive same functionality

        #Syntax
        property(fget=none,fset=none,fdel=none,doc=none)
        fget - function to get the value
        fset - function to set the value
        fdel - function to delete the attribute
        doc - string that serves as the documentation for the attribute
